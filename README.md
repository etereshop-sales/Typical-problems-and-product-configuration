<details>
<summary><strong>File Structure on the SD Card</strong></summary>

- The SD card must contain a configuration file (`config.txt`) and effect files.
- During activation, the controller creates a `protect.txt` file. Using an activator, a `key.txt` file is generated and placed on the SD card. After successful activation, these files are deleted.
- The effect list is also stored on the SD card. Effect files must follow this naming template:

Where `number` is a digit from 0 to 255. An optional name can follow to highlight the effect.

**Examples:**
- `S1.txt`
- `S16_logo.txt`
- `S21.txt`
- `S50_animated_text.txt`

- Numbering does not need to be sequential.
- You can create folders and store other files ‚Äî the controller will ignore them.

**For clients:**

1. `config.txt` ‚Äî product configuration file.  
2. Effect files: format `S<number>.txt`. Examples: `S1.txt`, `S2.txt`, `S5.txt`, `S70.txt`. Numbering does not have to be sequential. You may optionally add a name: `S12_logo.txt`, `S4_text.txt`.  
3. You can create folders and add other files ‚Äî they will not be recognized by the controller.

<summary><strong>Product Flashes in Certain Colors</strong></summary>

#### üî¥ Red Flashing

- Issue with the SD card: missing, improperly inserted, or faulty.
- Ensure the card is fully inserted.
- Check the SD card for errors using a USB adapter or card slot. If the computer detects the card but can't open it ‚Äî format it.

- If the issue persists, the controller‚Äôs SD slot may be damaged. Repair or replacement is required.

#### üî¥üîµ Red and Blue Flashing

- Problem with the activation file.
- Activation failed ‚Äî possibly due to a wrong or corrupted `key.txt` file.
- Solution: send us the `protect.txt` file from the SD card and we‚Äôll provide a valid key.

#### üî¥üü° Red and Yellow Flashing

- The controller cannot find the `config.txt` file.
- Ensure the `config.txt` file is present on the SD card.
- If it exists, check the SD card for errors (see red flashing issue above).

#### üî¥üü¢ Red and Green Flashing

- The controller cannot recognize DMX settings ‚Äî most likely the `channels.txt` file is missing.
- Create the file and specify the required channel numbers.

## Breakdowns

<details>
<summary><strong>LED is Constantly Lit Blue/Red/Green/Combination</strong><br><em>The Rest of the Product Works Correctly</em></summary>

- A part of the driver responsible for a specific color has burned out in the LED.
- The product can still be used like this if it's not critical for appearance.
- To repair, replace the affected diode.

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><strong>LED is Constantly Lit in One Color</strong><br><em>Part of the Product After It Does Not Work</em></summary>

- The LED has failed and needs to be replaced.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Controller or Wires Get Very Hot When Power is Connected</strong></summary>

- Most likely caused by a short circuit.
- Replace the controller with a repaired one if available, or purchase a new one.
- This could happen if the charger was connected directly to the controller (when there is no BMS), or if liquid was spilled on it.

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><strong>Product Displays Colors Incorrectly (Blue, Green Disappear), Slows Down or Freezes</strong></summary>

- Caused by over-discharge of batteries.
- Try connecting other charged batteries or power boxes for testing.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Part of the Product is Constantly Lit Blue</strong></summary>

- If the product uses PL-diodes, this indicates a break in the data wire.
- These diodes light up blue by default when there‚Äôs no control signal.
- Use the schematic/map to trace and find the break.

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><strong>Part of the Product Does Not Light Up</strong></summary>

- Use dynamic effects to determine the first unlit diode.
- A data break likely occurred at that point.
- It‚Äôs also possible the break occurred right at the controller output ‚Äî in this case, an entire section will not light up.

</details>

## Radio Setup

<details>
<summary><strong>General Radio Settings</strong></summary>

- Only effect numbers are transmitted via radio, whether using DMX or our radio controllers.
- It is highly recommended to use the first ten radio channels.
- As the channel number increases, signal transmission quality decreases.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Instructions for Two-Button Controller</strong></summary>

Two files must be present on the SD card:

1. `effects.txt` ‚Äî specifies the number of effects on the product.  
2. `channel.txt` ‚Äî specifies the radio channel number (1‚Äì100).

Additional files:
- `RF_log.txt` and `errors.txt` ‚Äî generated by the controller to store info about radio settings and operation.

**Button Functions:**
- Switch effects forward/backward.

**LED Indications:**
- Flashing red: radio module not detected; operation not possible.  
- Flashing orange: memory card not found; operates with default 20 effects.  
- Flashing yellow: `effects.txt` is missing or corrupted.  
- Flashing yellow-green: miscellaneous errors; possibly a failed channel change.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Radio Controller Switches All Products Instead of Specific Ones</strong></summary>

- By default, all products are configured to the first channel.
- To assign unique channels, add the following line to each product‚Äôs `config.txt`:


Where `N` is a number between 0 and 255 (ideally between 0‚Äì10 for best performance).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Radio Controller Does Not Control the Product</strong></summary>

1. Ensure the controller's channel matches the product‚Äôs assigned channel.
   - On the remote: selected via buttons.
   - On the product: set in `config.txt`.

2. Confirm the `rh.pattern` parameter exists in the product‚Äôs configuration.

3. For older products, there may be incompatibility between the product controller chip and the radio controller chip.
   - You can identify mismatched chips by their shape (square vs. rectangular).
   - Replace the radio controller if needed.
